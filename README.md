# Job Engine Library

Welcome to our Job Engine Library! This repository contains a powerful library designed to assist with the execution 
of regular or postponed tasks, or "jobs". It provides abstractions for declaring such jobs and their processors, 
making it easier to manage and execute tasks in a more efficient and organized manner.

## Features
1. **Job Declaration Abstractions**: Define and manage your jobs seamlessly with our easy-to-use abstractions.
2. **Job Processors**: Handle your jobs with our robust job processors.
3. **Postponed Jobs Support**: Not ready to execute a job? No worries! Our library supports postponed jobs.
4. **Job Statistics**: Keep track of your jobs with our detailed job statistics feature.
